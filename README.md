# Expense Manager

It is a mobile application project named Expense Manager developed solely in flutter and dart.

This project is a part of my project based learning of flutter and its concepts.
It is my first major project.
I have learned the following things from this project-

- basic concepts and widgets of flutter like Scaffold, container, Listview etc along with different ways to style them and dynamically change them
- creating responsive and adaptive user interface to match the requirements of different devices
- how to differentiate the app for ios and android platform 
- Data structures in dart like List and how to use them statically and dynamically
- how to use and format dates in our app 


This app is made with the concepts i have learned till date.
I haven't added the data storage functionality in this app, but we will implement it later
